        Sensational Nollywood actress Sharon Ooja's marriage to her husband Ugo Nwoke has raised eyebrows.
        This is because it is believed that her husband has had three previous failed marriages and Sharon 
        will be his fourth wife. Although her best friend Bisola came out to debunk the rumours, pictures
        actually surfaced online of his previous marriages. Sharon however seems unbothered as she claims
        the holy spirit approved of their union.
